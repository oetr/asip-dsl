;; Current problem with the macro solution:
;; two definitions of the same thing:
;; 1) simulator,
;; 2) conversion to vhdl code

;; Possible solution:
;; an interpreter to convert the DSL code into some form that can
;; be both: simulated and converted to VHDL based on user choice

;; Another way:
;; Two interpreters (or one interpreter and one compiler)
;; for the same code
;; 1) The first one simulated the code
;; 2) The second converts it to VHDL

;; The simulator should support concurrent execution
;; Should probably add delays for all standard operations
